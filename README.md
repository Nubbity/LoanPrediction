# LoanPrediction
My first dive into Neural Networks and PyTorch

There has been a lot of hype about Neural Networks and I wanted to learn better how they work.

# My first steps:

  I have seen a lot of project videos in youtube where people automated gameplay etc. and I had somekind of grasp how the models work.
  My way of understanding and learning the coding process was to select a tutorial playlist by Patrick Loeber and following it trough

# First own project

  After the tutorials I wanted to make my own project from scratch and chose to attend a Kaggle competion with my project.
  My goal was to learn about Neural networks and how they work more than win the competition itself, but managed to get satisfying score around 85% with the test   data & 93% AUC with the validation data. The prior experiencfe with machine learning helped me to better understand the process, data handling and metrics but the new challenge was to apply the Neural Network
